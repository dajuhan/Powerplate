## Observation :
### Observation Statement:
Surprisingly, less than half of the respondents (45.8%) are willing to pay for extra recipe generation, despite expectations that more would prioritize this feature.

### Supporting Data:
- Only 45.8% (11 respondents) selected extra recipe generation as a feature worth paying for.

### Team Action (if any):
Reevaluate the value proposition for recipe generation and consider bundling it with other desirable features, such as the ad-free experience or meal planning calendars, to increase user interest.

### Observation :

**Observation Statement**:  
A macronutrient-tracking feature is not important to users.

**Supporting Data**:  
When asked “What feature is most important to you in an app”, only 4.2% of users selected “Calories burnt via workout tracking + macro tracking”.

**Team Action (if any)**:  
The team should not implement a macronutrient-tracking feature, and instead focus on the other features that more users selected as being important to them.
