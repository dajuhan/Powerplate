## Observation :
### Observation Statement:
Surprisingly, less than half of the respondents (45.8%) are willing to pay for extra recipe generation, despite expectations that more would prioritize this feature.

### Supporting Data:
- Only 45.8% (11 respondents) selected extra recipe generation as a feature worth paying for.

### Team Action (if any):
Reevaluate the value proposition for recipe generation and consider bundling it with other desirable features, such as the ad-free experience or meal planning calendars, to increase user interest.
