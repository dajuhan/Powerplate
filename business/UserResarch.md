## Observation :
### Observation Statement:
Surprisingly, less than half of the respondents (45.8%) are willing to pay for extra recipe generation, despite expectations that more would prioritize this feature.

### Supporting Data:
- Only 45.8% (11 respondents) selected extra recipe generation as a feature worth paying for.

### Team Action (if any):
Reevaluate the value proposition for recipe generation and consider bundling it with other desirable features, such as the ad-free experience or meal planning calendars, to increase user interest.

### Observation :

**Observation Statement**:  
A macronutrient-tracking feature is not important to users.

**Supporting Data**:  
When asked “What feature is most important to you in an app”, only 4.2% of users selected “Calories burnt via workout tracking + macro tracking”.

**Team Action (if any)**:  
The team should not implement a macronutrient-tracking feature, and instead focus on the other features that more users selected as being important to them.



### Observation: Diet Restrictions: 

**Observation Statement**:
I noticed that most people don't have diet restrictions.

**Supporting Data**:
When asked about what type of diet people are on, 90.9% of people were omnivorous. 

**Tema Action (if any)**:
We plan to make our app have a more broader audience instead of mostly focusing on people with diets



## Observation : Time to prepare meals
### Observation Statement:
The majority had said they spend 30 to 60 minutes for preparing meals and 11 had said less than 30 minutes and 9 had said more than 1 hour.

### Supporting Data:
45.8% had responded that they spend 30 to 60 minutes preparing for meals. 

### Team Action (if any):
Would have to make the app suit the time constraints that users have when preparing meals.
