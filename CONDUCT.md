# Team Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the 305Soft team pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best for the entire community, not just ourselves

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (such as a physical or email address) without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Specific Guidelines

### No Distracted Use of Technology

During all team meetings, all members are expected to avoid distractions, including using phones or unrelated technology.

### Decisions

Team decisions will be made through group consensus with majority ruling.

### Attendance

Members are expected to attend all classes and scheduled team meetings. Legitimate reasons for missing include illness or emergencies, and members must notify the team in advance. Missing members are responsible for catching up on what they missed.

### Assignments

The Scrum Master will assign tasks, but members may also volunteer for assignments. If any member cannot complete an assignment on time, they must inform the team as soon as possible so adjustments can be made.

### Participation

Team members are expected to communicate effectively and respond to messages in a timely manner. Discussions will primarily take place on Discord, which will be used for both coding collaboration and general discussions.

### Meeting Times and Locations

Meeting times and locations will be decided as a group, ensuring they are convenient for all members. The primary platform for meetings will be Discord.

### Promptness and Conversational Courtesies

Team members are expected to be on time to meetings. Active listening and respectful dialogue are encouraged, and each member should share airtime fairly. Tangents should be minimized to keep the conversation on track.

### Enforcement and Feedback

Feedback will be given and received respectfully. Constructive criticism should be balanced with positive reinforcement. Members should communicate early if they foresee issues with completing a task or attending a meeting. Failure to communicate or habitual lateness will result in discussions to determine how the team will address the issue.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Team leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair action in response to behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. This can include editing or removing contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the team leads via [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Unprofessional or unwelcome behavior.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. Interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, will be limited for a specified period.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from all community interaction and communication.

### 4. Permanent Ban
