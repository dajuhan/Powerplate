### A/B Test 1: Progress Tracking Frequency (Daily vs. Weekly)
- **Metrics:** Retention, Engagement (frequency of use), User Satisfaction
- **Hypothesis:** Offering users the choice to see progress on a daily basis will increase engagement, as users feel more motivated by immediate feedback on their diet and macro tracking.
- **Problem & Impact:** Currently, only weekly progress tracking is available, which may reduce engagement for users who seek immediate feedback on their health journey.
- **Experiment:** 
  - **Audience:** 60% of users in daily tracking, 40% in weekly tracking to avoid overwhelming users.
  - **Tracking:** Firebase Analytics will track the frequency of progress tracking, user satisfaction, and retention metrics.
- **Variations:**
  - **Variation A:** Daily progress tracking option.
  - **Variation B:** Weekly progress tracking only.
